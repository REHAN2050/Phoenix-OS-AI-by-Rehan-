# ðŸ§  Modular AI Architecture

Phoenix OS AI is built with 3 layers:

### 1. Input Layer
- Accepts user files, chat, and instructions
- Supports video, PDF, text, image

### 2. AI Core Layer
- Multiple AI modules work together
- Can share output internally (based on permissions)

### 3. Response Layer
- Filters based on selected AI model
- Final response is given in the userâ€™s selected format

> This system is designed to evolve as models improve.
